#### Idea
Each year investigators patiently await the announcements of NHMRC funding. After submitting an application in March and rebutting the reviewers’ comments mid-year, it will not be until October that they find out if they have received funds or not. Keep in mind that academic research is largely funded through grants such as these. There is a lot of publicly available data on investigators and teams awarded NHMRC funding, along with a lot of statistics available. It would be terrific to be able to quickly visualise these results without poring through a large number of pdf files and spreadsheets. If we could quickly generate some user-friendly, easy-to-read graphics that clearly explain where the funding goes each year, it would allow individuals, institutes and other interested parties to readily view the funding landscape.

#### Why
As an individual researcher or an organisation, such a tool would allow you to work out the demographics of successful applicants, at what level and in what research areas, without having to pore through the data.  It will also inform policy development at the institute and national level since any group or association will be able to readily access this information. Just enter the terms you wish to define and ‘voila’, a graph with your desired information will appear.
