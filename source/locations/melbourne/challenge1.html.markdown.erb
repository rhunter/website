The internet is a quagmire of health information, health misinformation and health disinformation. Public health information services, both in government and the broader civil society, are interested in communications activities which inform people of how to approach this information critically. Improving public critical thinking in the use of these information sources should increase the efficiency and outcomes of human/health-system interactions. Critical thinking is a verb. Top-down dissemination of information will not support this sort of learning. Developments in interactive journalism may be able to provide a way to impact upon public critical thinking.

Our problem is to develop a data-journalism tool that can be used to facilitate content coding of online videos and visualise patterns in that content. Such a tool would provide virtual communities a broad perspective of a curated media landscape. For example, a person who has been recently diagnosed with a mental illness might be interested in understanding the media around their diagnosis. A not-for-profit working to relieve mental illness might be interested in facilitating that conversation about media perceptions. In response to a disease outbreak, (such as ebola), an individual may be interested in understanding how the media representations shape our perceptions. An international relief agency may be interested in monitoring the response to inform their media campaigns for donations.

#### Example Video Coding Tasks:

- Purpose of creator
- Imputed Target Demographic
- Medical Treatments referenced
- Geocoding (place references)
- Demographics of video ‘Actors’
- Sentiment
- Open Description
- Validation of the above
